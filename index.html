          <p>
            Zoro is a muscular man of average height with lightly tanned skin.
            He always carries his three swords along with him, bundled up with a
            green haramaki over his right hip, allowing him to easily draw them
            with his left hand. Of the three swords he has on his person, he has
            always been seen carrying the Wado Ichimonji, while his other two
            swords have varied over time due to them being destroyed and
            subsequently replaced with progressively better ones. Although his
            right hand is usually seen resting over them, he can also use this
            hand to pull his swords out before sitting down. He has three
            identical gold earrings on his left earlobe. Zoro normally keeps a
            black bandana tied around his left bicep and ties it around his head
            when he is fighting seriously against an opponent.

              <h3 class="title">Zoro and Kuina</h3>
              <p>
                Zoro was born 21 years ago in the East Blue.By the time he was 8 years old, Zoro trained at a dojo in Shimotsuki Village.Even as a child, Zoro was strong enough to defeat most adults, but could not defeat Kuina, the daughter of the dojo's master, Koushirou. During a training session, he got to meet Kuina's grandfather, Shimotsuki Kozaburo, who gifted him a pair of swords to aid in his practice.After their 2000th fight (and Kuina's 2000th victory), Zoro challenged her in private for one more matchâ€”with real swords. Although he had improved tremendously since their first match, he still lost and cried with frustration, telling Kuina about his dream of becoming the world's greatest swordsman.

              <p>
                Zoro learned of Dracule "Hawk-Eye" Mihawk, who currently holds the title of the greatest swordsman in the world. He set off to sea, searching for him in order to challenge him to a duel. However, he lost his way and could not find his way back home.In order to survive on his own, he took on bounties to pay for living expenses. He quickly built a famous reputation for himself as a "Pirate Hunter" in the East Blue

              <p>
                During his journey, Zoro arrived in Shells Town where Helmeppo, the spoiled son of the corrupted Marine captain, Axe-Hand Morgan, released his pet wolf in town. It attempted to attack a girl named Rika, but Zoro saved her by killing it. it is presumed that Helmeppo told Zoro to agree to be tied to a pole for a month to gain amnesty which would preserve his reputation in the Marines' eyes.On the ninth day of Zoro's restraint, Koby and Monkey D. Luffy arrived in town with the intentions of Koby joining the Marines and Luffy inviting Zoro to be his first crewmember.
